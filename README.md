# Reusable GitHub Workflows

This repository hosts [re-usable github workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows).
Some of this workflows are configured as [starter workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/creating-starter-workflows-for-your-organization)
in [.github](https://github.com/zaphiro-technologies/.github), so that you can add them at any time from the actions page.
